# Biography
I'm Zhiheng Liu, I'm in Sunnyvale CA now. I work as a software engineer intern in Google Cloud Platform. Before coming to the United States, I worked for China Mobile Research Institute(Cloud networking team) for four years. I contributed one international standard (RFC8099) and 27 technical proposals to Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as well as five patents. I love working on cloud technology such as network function virtualization (NFV), software-defined network (SDN), control plane networking system.
