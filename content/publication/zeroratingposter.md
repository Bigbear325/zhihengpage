abstract = "Many Internet service providers offer zero-rating services for contracted or affiliated content providers to allow users to access specific contents via cellular or WiFi network free of charge. However, these kinds of servers are vulnerable and easy to compromise for free-riding. In this poster, we will focus on an analysis of the vulnerability of the mobile zero-rating network and introduces the demonstration of free-riding attack. In addition, we illustrate a survey of free-riding attack experiments on several real-world ISP via both unencrypted and encrypted traffic."
